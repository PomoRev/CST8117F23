			<P> 
			This is me enjoying my time with friends playing boardgames up at the family cottage. Every year I like to have a large group of friends join us at the cottage for a day filled with boardgames, food, and swimming if the lake is warm enough. Often we will have two or three different games going at once. Sadly this year, because of the responsible choice to social distance, we did not have any large gatherings up at the cottage to play games.
